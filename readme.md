# Backend API + Smart contracts


## Hardhat
The "hardhat" folder contains the smart contract, test and deployment scripts. To deploy, you'll need to fill private keys and RPC url in .env.

## Backend API (Work in progress)
This root folder has the backend API that is meant to...
-verify a user's login to each platform (obtain code/token, query api)
-call smart contract to store results

Some parts are working but due to time, this was left incomplete.
